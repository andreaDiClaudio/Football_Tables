Used this snippet to check if the ordering of the list was correctly done, the expected result was only one team out of order
And first on the list.

superLigaen.Teams[0].Points = 2;

List<Team> ordered = superLigaen.Teams.OrderByDescending(team => team.Points)
                                    //.ThenByDescending(team => (team.GoalsFor - team.GoalsAgainst))
                                    //.ThenByDescending(team => team.GoalsFor)
                                    //.ThenByDescending(team => team.GoalsAgainst)
                                    .ThenBy(team => team.FullName)
                                    .ToList();

            foreach (Team team in ordered)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(team.ToString());
            }
